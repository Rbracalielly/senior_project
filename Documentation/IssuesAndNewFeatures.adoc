# Issues Doc

## What is this document?
This is a living document where members of the team can add in known issues to the application as well as document new futures that can be added. 

##Current issues 
1.)	Sign page shows a lot of information at once
- This can be corrected by hiding the create user option by using a hide function. This way the create user fields is not seen. 
2.)	User sign in ask for email address rather than username
- We should change this field to use username or just remove username all together
3.)	Reports not loading data
- This is due when a user submits info for calories or dinks a date time value is not passed through the database. It would best to use a cookie to submit a date time stamp so reports can be added one
4.)	Remove java scripts
- We should remove the java alerts and code in proper error codes for an end user to see. Make sure proper error codes do not have tables reference names. 
5.)	Definitions 
- Better definitions on calorie limit and goals. 
- Hydration pages table is confusing and could be redefined. 
6.)	Adding in meals and drinks
- Forum should clear after adding in calories 
7.)	Gender value always passing male
 - Work around idea was to use a free box that states something like “Gender (Please Enter M, F, or O)”
8.)	Images not showing 
 - Need proper file references in jail.  
 
 ##Features to add 
1.)	Security 
- Use SSL
- Hashing passwords rather than storing as plain text 
2.)	Bootstrap 
- Add in Bootstrap for mobile devices to browse page 
3.)	Reports 
- Options for daily, weekly, and monthly
- Add option for date picker rather than manual entry
4.)	Meals
