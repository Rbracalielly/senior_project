# Issues Doc

## What is this document?
This is a living document where members of the team can add in known issues to the application as well as document new futures that can be added.

## Current issues {nbsp} +
1.)	Sign page shows a lot of information at once {nbsp} +
- This can be corrected by hiding the create user option by using a hide function. This way the create user fields is not seen. {nbsp} +
- Ryan added a show/hide function that hides the new user information feilds 4/15/2020 {nbsp} +
2.)	User sign in ask for email address rather than username {nbsp} +
- We should change this field to use username or just remove username all together {nbsp} +
- Ryan Bracalielly changed user sign up page now uses user name rather than email 4/15/2020 {nbsp} +
3.)	Reports not loading data {nbsp} +
- This is due when a user submits info for calories or dinks a date time value is not passed through the database. It would best to use a cookie to submit a date time stamp so reports can be added one {nbsp} +
- Ryan Bracalielly chagne the various queries to that insert datat to use the NOW() function to add in a date time for when data is added. This would be an issue for user in different time zones but that will take to code. {nbsp} +
4.)	Remove java scripts {nbsp} +
- We should remove the java alerts and code in proper error codes for an end user to see. Make sure proper error codes do not have tables reference names. {nbsp} +
5.)	Definitions {nbsp} +
- Better definitions on calorie limit and goals. {nbsp} +
- Hydration pages table is confusing and could be redefined. {nbsp} +
6.)	Adding in meals and drinks {nbsp} +
- Forum should clear after adding in calories {nbsp} +
7.)	Gender value always passing male {nbsp} +
 - Work around idea was to use a free box that states something like “Gender (Please Enter M, F, or O)” {nbsp} +
  - Work around complete. {nbsp} +
8.)	Images not showing  {nbsp} +
 - Need proper file references in jail. {nbsp} +

## Features to add {nbsp} +
